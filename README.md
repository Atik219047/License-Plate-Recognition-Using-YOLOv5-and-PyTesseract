Objective:
Develop a system to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in real-time.

Technologies Used:
- YOLOv5: An advanced object detection model for identifying license plates in images and video.
- PyTesseract: An OCR tool for extracting text from the detected license plates.

Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of vehicle images with annotated license plates.
2. Model Training: Train the YOLOv5 model to recognize and locate license plates.
3. Detection: Use the trained model to process images or video and detect license plates.
4. Recognition: Apply PyTesseract to extract text from detected plates.
5. Evaluation: Test the systemâ€™s accuracy and robustness under various conditions.
